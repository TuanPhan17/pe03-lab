## Overview  
This program uses a menu system to practice Python concepts with **lists and tuples**.

---

## 1️⃣ People List  
Creates and edits a list of dinner guests using `.append()`, `.insert()`, and `.pop()` to modify and update the list.

---

## 2️⃣ Animal List  
Creates a list of animals and uses **slicing** to print the first three, middle three, and last three items.

---

## 3️⃣ Duplicate List  
Finds and prints numbers that appear more than once in a list.

---

## 4️⃣ Food Tuple  
Stores foods in a tuple, shows tuples can’t be changed, then rewrites a new tuple to display an updated menu.

---

## 5️⃣ Sort Tuple  
Creates a list of tuples and sorts them by the **second value** using `key=lambda x: x[1]`.

---

## How to Run the Program  
```bash
