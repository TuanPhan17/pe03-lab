## Overview
This Python program uses a menu system to run small projects that practice working with **lists and tuples**.

---

## 1️⃣ People List
Creates and edits a list of dinner guests using list methods like `.append()`, `.insert()`, and `.pop()` to modify and update the list.

---

## 2️⃣ Animal List
Creates a list of animals and uses **slicing** to print the first three, middle three, and last three items from the list.

---

## 3️⃣ Duplicate List
Finds and prints numbers that appear more than once in a list.

---

## 4️⃣ Food Tuple
Stores foods in a tuple, shows that tuples can’t be changed, then rewrites the tuple to display an updated menu.

---

## ⋯– How to Run the Program
```bash
python3 pe03.py
